# Aim:
The aim of a prompt-based application tailored to personal needs is to enhance creativity, improve productivity, foster learning, and streamline daily routines. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models, users can receive structured prompts that stimulate problem-solving and encourage innovative thinking. The application can assist in organizing daily tasks efficiently, providing AI-powered suggestions that optimize time management and workflow

# AI Tools Required: 

- GPT->based AI models for task analysis and optimization.
- Notion AI or Zapier for automation and workflow integration.
- Google Calendar API for scheduling tasks and reminders.
- Streamlit or Flask (Python) for creating a web-based task manager.


# Explanation: 
### Prompt:
"Design an AI-powered habit-building assistant that helps users set goals, track progress, and receive personalized motivation to stay consistent. The assistant should adapt to the user’s success rate and offer adjustments to improve adherence over time."

## Procedure:
### 1. Define Objectives & Scope
- Identify the primary function: setting goals, tracking habits, offering motivation.
- Determine adaptability features to enhance user engagement over time.
### 2. Choose AI & Tech Stack
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables conversational interaction.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Analyzes user success rates and optimizes suggestions.
- Database & Cloud Storage: Stores habit progress for personalized adaptation.
- Integration with APIs: Connects to calendars, reminders, and wearable devices.
### 3. Develop User Interface
- Chat-Based Interaction: Users set goals via text or voice commands.
- Dashboard Display: Visual habit progress tracker with recommendations.
- Reminder System: Push notifications, email, or smart assistant alerts.
### 4. Implement Habit Tracking System
- Users input habits and define frequency (daily, weekly).
- AI records completion rates, identifies patterns, and adjusts strategies.
- Generates periodic reports on consistency and improvement areas.
### 5. Personalization & Adaptation
- AI learns user behavior and modifies reminders for better adherence.
- Suggests habit stacking—combining multiple positive behaviors.
- Motivates users with gamification elements (streak tracking, achievements).
### 6. Testing & Continuous Improvement
- Conduct usability tests to refine habit recommendations.
- Update AI model with feedback for better personalization.
## Prompt
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries . The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

#### 1. Daily Task Manager
 **User:**
"I have a meeting at 10 AM, a report due by 3 PM, and I need to buy groceries. Can you organize my tasks?"
**AI Assistant:**

"Sure! Here's your schedule for the day:
- 10:00 AM: Meeting
- 12:00 PM: Quick lunch
- 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Work on report
- 5:00 PM: Grocery shopping
I will remind you for these using alarm.

#### 2. Smart Scheduler
**User:**

"Can you find the best time for me to work out today?"
**AI Assistant:**

"Based on your schedule, you have free time between 3:30 PM and 4:30 PM. Would you like me to schedule a workout session during that time?"

#### 3. Wellness Tips Generator
**User:**

"I’ve been feeling stressed lately. Any tips?"
**AI Assistant:** 

"Stress relief is important! Try taking a 5-minute mindfulness break, breathing exercises, or a short walk. Would you like me to schedule relaxation reminders throughout the day?"

#### 4. General Knowledge Helper
**User:**

"Can you tell me some interesting facts about space?"
**AI Assistant:** 

"Absolutely! Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once, while it takes only 225 days to orbit the Sun."

#### 5. User Personalization and Learning
**User:**
"I’ve been skipping my morning meditation. Can you remind me differently?"
**AI Assistant:** 

"I noticed you've missed your meditation sessions. Instead of morning reminders, I can schedule them in the evening when you seem more available. Does that work for you?"
